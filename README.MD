# Description of the project

For those reading, I created a parser that reads multiple folders of ABC files which in turn identifies each tune inside them and uses that information to insert every tune into a database for analysis.

# Instructions for use


# How it works:
## Parser:
- I scan the entrie abc_books folder and look inside each numbered subfolder
- Every .abc file is read line by line to identify tune selections by markers like X: T: R: K:
- I store each tunes as a dictionary containing all of its metadata and its body text
- The parser supports files that hold multiiple tunes in one file
## Database:

## Pandas Data Analysis:

## Tkinter:

## CLI Menu:

## GUI Header:
